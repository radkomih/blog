As you may see, I am interested in way too many things, but I think I am not alone. 
Here I'll be documenting my journey, while exploring, learning, and building things, that others could benefit from too.

And here are some of the domains that I am constantly exploring:
- Open Science & Education
- Learning & Hacking
- Privacy
- Blockchain, Web3 & Decentralization
- Math
- Money

While doing so, I will stick to some basic principles that helps better manage the complexity in the process:
- question and seek answers by yourself
- don't stop learning (draws from the experience of others)
- systemize, categorize and take away the important stuff
- complexity could be reduced to many simpler concepts (I hope so)
- be persistent, but don't be afraid of changes (when necessary)
- context is the king
- There is no free lunch, we always pay with something (time, money, health, authority, information... just know when you pay with what)
